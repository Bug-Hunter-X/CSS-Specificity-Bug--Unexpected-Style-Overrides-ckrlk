# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Style Overrides

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in CSS related to specificity.  The bug occurs when later defined styles unintentionally override earlier styles due to conflicting class or ID names. This conflict can be difficult to diagnose because the overriding style does not appear to violate normal specificity rules at first glance.  The provided solution illustrates how to properly resolve this issue by carefully examining and adjusting the class and ID names.

## Bug Description
The issue arises from a naming collision where two selectors, while seemingly distinct, end up having equal or higher specificity than intended.  This leads to unexpected style overrides and visual inconsistencies in the rendered output.

## Solution
The solution involves analyzing the CSS code to pinpoint the conflicting selectors.  By modifying class or ID names or restructuring CSS rules to manage specificity appropriately, the bug can be effectively resolved.
